# 📘 E-learn_Console_App  

## 📌 Overview  
`E-learn_Console_App` is a C# **Console Application** that demonstrates how to use **ADO.NET** to perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an **Instructor** table.  

The project showcases **Mixed Mode** data access:  
- **Connected Mode** → using `SqlCommand` and `SqlDataReader` to interact with the database directly.  
- **Disconnected Mode** → using `DataSet` and `SqlDataAdapter` to work with data offline.  

To make the code more structured, the app follows **OOP principles** by creating an `Instructor` class to represent instructor objects (instead of just writing raw SQL queries).
